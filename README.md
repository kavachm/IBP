This code is the MATLAB implementation of the super-resolution algorithm Iterative Back Projection (IBP), utilizing a single low resolution image as input. 
The code has been created following the principles of IBP mentioned in Yang et al. (2014). Default parameter values mentioned in Yang et al. (2014) have been taken, assuming that they yield satisfactory results in our research.
